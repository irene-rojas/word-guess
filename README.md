This is a word guessing game made with the <a href="https://dictionaryapi.com/"> Merriam-Webster Dictionary API</a> in React. The user is presented with a definition and then required to select from three word choices. If the user selects correctly, they are congratulated with the option to learn more about the word through a link to the Merriam-Webster page about that word. If the user selects incorrectly, they are also given the option to learn about the correct word. Both results contain a button to reset the game with a new definition and word collection.
